# mini-game-python
A mini-game in python to explain the topic of loops and statements (for, while).
I hope someone likes it.
Hello everyone! Today, I decided to diversify my day and created a simple mini-game in Python, which can be used to explain the topic of loops and operators (for, while) or other educational processes. The game involves guessing a random number from 1 to 9. xD
